A proprietary [[GPGPU]] programming platform made by NVIDIA, that provides an interface with the GPU through a superset of [[C++]] or a superset of [[Fortran]]. Heavily used in both [[High Performance Computing]] and [[Real Time Computing]]. Has a robust library ecosystem.

The specific features are not defined by an [[Architecture]], but by the specific [[Hardware]]. Therefore, CUDA is not hardware-agnostic and must take into account the hardware it is running on.

If you use features like CUTLASS, CuTE, thrust, etc. CUDA can become an [[Array Programming Language]], which is ideal when working with [[Tensor]]s.

# Typical CUDA Program
1. CPU allocates CPU memory
2. CPU copies data to GPU
3. CPU launches kernel on GPU (processing is done here)
4. CPU copies results from GPU back to CPU to do something useful with it

Kernel looks like a serial program; says nothing about parallelism. Imagine you are trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle and all you are given is the location of each puzzle piece. The high level algorithm would be designed to take these individual pieces, and solve a single problem for each of them; “put the piece in the correct spot”. As long as all the pieces are assembled in the right place at the end, it works! You don't need to start at one corner and work your way across the puzzle. You can solve multiple pieces at the same time, as long as they don't interfere with each other.

# Kernel
A GPU [[Computer Science/Architecture/Function|Subroutine]].

# Host
The [[CPU]]; uses [[RAM]] on the Motherboard

# Device 
The [[GPU]]; uses the on-chip [[VRAM]] 

# Conventions
`h_A` is the host version of the variable `A`

`d_A` is the device version of the variable `A`

# Function Execution Space Specifiers
`__global__`
* marks a kernel
* runs on GPU
* is visible globally (global [[VRAM]])
* must return void
* uses `<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>` syntax

`__device__`
* runs on GPU
* can be called from other GPU code

`__host__`
* default function on host
* usually not explicitly marked

# Memory Management
`cudaMalloc`
* [[malloc]] but it's CUDA

`cudaMemcpy`
* copying data
	* from device to host ⇒ cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost
	* from host to device ⇒ cudaMemcpyHostToDevice
	* from device to device ⇒ cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice

`cudaFree`
* [[free]] but it's CUDA

# Compiler
For regular [[C++]] we would probably use [[gcc]] or [[clang]]
For CUDA, we have [[nvcc]]
![[nvcc]]

# Hierarchy
- `dim3 gridDim` ⇒ number of blocks per grid
- `uint3 blockIdx` ⇒ index of the block in the grid
- `dim3 blockDim` ⇒ number of threads per block
- `uint3 threadIdx` ⇒ index of the thread in the block
You can have this hierarchy in 3 dimensions
![[Pasted image 20251201202340.png|300]]
## Thread
A thread is the smallest execution unit
* Each thread executes the same kernel code but oeprates on a different part/index of the data
* It has its own private local memory (registers)
* It has a unique index within its block accessible via `threadIdx.<axis>`
## Warp
Warps are inside of blocks are parllelize 32 threads (or whatever the warp size is).
- Instructions are issued to warps that then tell the threads what to do (not directly sent to threads)

The total number of warps in a block is:

$$
\left\lceil  \frac{T_{B}}{S_{W}}  \right\rceil 
= (T_{B} + S_{W} - 1) / S_{W}
$$

* where $T_{B}$ is the threads per block, defined below in [[#Block]]
* where $S_{W}$  is the size of a warp, which is usually 32

See [[Integer Ceil Divide]]
## Block
A group of threads that can communicate and synchronize with each other.
* Threads within the same block can share data quickly using [[#Shared Memory]] and synchronize their execution using `__syncthreads()`
* It has a unique index within the grid, accessible via `blockIdx.<axis>`
* The dimensions of the block are accessible via `blockDim`
* Hard limit for threads per block is 1024
* Optimal block size: $S_{B} = 32 n\ s.t.\ n \in \mathbb{N}^+,\ 32n \leq 1024$
* Optimal limit for threads per block: $T_{B} = \left\lceil  \frac{N}{S_{B}}  \right\rceil \equiv$ `(N + blockDim- 1) / blockDim`
## Grid
The entire set of blocks that execute the kernel
* The kernel is launched as a single grid
* Blocks in the same grid are independent of each other and cannot communicate directly or synchonize
* Blocks can be executed in any order
* The dimensions of the grid are accessible via `gridDim`
## Kernel
The entire [[Process]] is defined by the kernel, which is the function being executed on the GPU
* When you launch a kernel, you specify the configuration of the grid and blocks using the execution configuration syntax: `<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>`
### Kernel Launch Parameters
- The execution configuration (of a global function call) is specified by inserting an expression of the form `<<<gridDim, blockDim, Ns, S>>>`, where:
    - gridDim (dim3) specifies the dimension and size of the grid.
    - blockDim (dim3) specifies the dimension and size of each block
    - Ns (size_t) specifies the number of bytes in shared memory that is dynamically allocated per block for this call in addition to the statically allocated memory. (typically omitted)
    - S (cudaStream_t) specifies the associated stream, is an optional parameter which defaults to 0.

`dim3` vs `int`
```c
dim3 gridDim(a, b, c); // a blocks in x, b in y, c in z
dim3 blockDim(d, e, f); // d threads in x, e in y, f in z
```

```c
int gridDim = abc // abc blocks
int blockDim = def // def threads per block
```
* gridDim ⇒ gridDim.x * gridDim.y * gridDim.z = # of blocks being launched
* blockDim ⇒ blockDim.x * blockDim.y * blockDim.z = # of threads per block
* total threads = (threads per block) * # of blocks = gridDim * blockDim

# Memory Tiers
## Global Memory
## Shared Memory
## Local Memory
## Constant Memory
## Texture Memory

# Synchronization
* `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` ⇒ await all threads to finish, **outside** a kernel
* `__syncthreads()` ⇒ await all threads within the same block up, making sure they all get up to this point, inside a kernel
* `__syncwarps()` ⇒ await all threads within the same warp to finish a phase of execution, inside a kernel (only neccessary in specific scenarios, where such synchronization isn't already a guarantee)
